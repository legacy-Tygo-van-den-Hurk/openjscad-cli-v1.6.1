# openjscad-cli-v1.6.1

This is all the files you need to run the openjscad cli (v1.6.1). Why? well nix needs a repo to fetch, and this is all it needs to run the program. The sole purpose of this repo wil be to host this CLI in a way that Nix can fetch it. That is why the node_modules folder is included.

it just needs to be fetched, and executed.
